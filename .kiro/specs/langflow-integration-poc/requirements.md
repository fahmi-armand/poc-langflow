# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This PoC demonstrates integration between our applications and Langflow through a FastAPI backend that serves as a bridge between a Next.js frontend and Langflow's API. The system allows users to browse available Langflow flows and execute them through our interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of available Langflow flows, so that I can select which flow to execute.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the frontend THEN the system SHALL display a list of flows retrieved from Langflow
2. WHEN retrieving flows THEN the backend SHALL call `http://localhost:7860/api/v1/flows/?components_only=true&get_all=true`
3. WHEN displaying flows THEN the system SHALL show flow name, description, and tags for each flow
4. IF the Langflow API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select and execute a specific Langflow flow, so that I can interact with the flow and receive responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a flow THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to input parameters for that flow
2. WHEN the user submits input THEN the backend SHALL send a POST request to `http://localhost:7860/api/v1/run/{flow_id}`
3. WHEN executing a flow THEN the system SHALL include required parameters: input_value, output_type, input_type, and tweaks
4. WHEN the flow execution completes THEN the system SHALL display the response to the user
5. IF the flow execution fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FastAPI backend that acts as a bridge, so that the frontend can communicate with Langflow through our controlled API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests flows THEN the backend SHALL proxy the request to Langflow and return the response
2. WHEN the frontend executes a flow THEN the backend SHALL proxy the execution request to Langflow
3. WHEN handling requests THEN the backend SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN responding to requests THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive Next.js frontend interface, so that I can easily browse and interact with Langflow flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the frontend SHALL fetch and display the list of flows
2. WHEN displaying flows THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and user-friendly
3. WHEN a user selects a flow THEN the interface SHALL show a form for input parameters
4. WHEN submitting a flow execution THEN the interface SHALL show loading states and results
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the interface SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic where appropriate
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL maintain graceful degradation
