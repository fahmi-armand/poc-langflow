# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up project structure and dependencies

  - Create FastAPI backend directory structure with main.py, models, services, and routers
  - Create Next.js frontend with TypeScript configuration
  - Install required dependencies for both backend (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, pydantic) and frontend (next, react, typescript, axios)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 2. Create Langflow service layer

  - Implement LangflowService class with httpx client for API communication
  - Add get_flows() method to fetch flows from Langflow API
  - Add execute_flow() method to run flows via Langflow API
  - Implement error handling and retry logic for network operations
  - Write unit tests for service methods with mocked Langflow responses
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 3. Implement FastAPI endpoints and middleware

  - Create GET /api/flows endpoint that proxies to Langflow flows API
  - Create POST /api/flows/{flow_id}/execute endpoint for flow execution
  - Add basic error handling for consistent error responses
  - Implement CORS middleware for frontend communication
  - Add simple request logging
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5.1_

- [ ] 4. Create Next.js frontend API client

  - Implement API client service with axios for backend communication
  - Add fetchFlows() method to retrieve flows from backend
  - Add executeFlow() method to execute flows via backend
  - Implement error handling and response parsing
  - Write unit tests for API client methods
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.5_

- [ ] 5. Build flow list component

  - Create FlowList component to display available flows
  - Implement flow data fetching on component mount
  - Add loading states and error handling for flow retrieval
  - Style component with responsive design
  - Add search and filter functionality for flows
  - Write component tests for different states (loading, success, error)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Build flow execution component

  - Create FlowExecution component with simple input form
  - Add flow execution logic with loading states
  - Display execution results and handle different response types
  - Implement basic error handling for execution failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Integrate components and add navigation

  - Create main page component that combines FlowList and FlowExecution
  - Implement flow selection logic to pass selected flow to execution component
  - Add navigation between flow list and execution views
  - Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes
  - Add global error boundary for unhandled errors
  - Write integration tests for component interaction
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and logging

  - Enhance backend logging with structured logging format
  - Add request/response logging for debugging
  - Implement frontend error toast notifications
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
  - Create error reporting utilities
  - Write tests for error scenarios and recovery
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
